# ☀️ Forecasting the Impact of High Solar Module Temperature on CO₂ Mitigation

**A Machine Learning Approach | Published in IEEE SSDEE 2025**

This project models and forecasts the CO₂ mitigation losses in photovoltaic (PV) plants caused by elevated solar module temperatures. Using historical operational data and advanced regression algorithms (Extra Trees Regressor), this work quantifies the impact of temperature on energy efficiency and resulting environmental losses.
